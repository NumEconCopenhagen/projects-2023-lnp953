# Inaugural project

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [inauguralproject.ipynb](inauguralproject.ipynb) which relies on [inauguralproject.py] (inauguralproject.py).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.

In this project, I explore the elasticity of the relative labor supply within households, specifically between females and males, in relation to the relative market wages of females and males. I also estimate fitting parameters for a model that can capture these dynamics. However, the results suggest that the model may not be a good fit for the data unless one are willing to make bold assumptions regarding productivity and/or relative disutility of labor for either gender. By investigating these relationships and potential limitations, I will gain insights into the complexities of labor supply within households and the factors that influence it.
