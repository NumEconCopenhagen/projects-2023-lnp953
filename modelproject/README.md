# Model analysis project

Our project is titled **The AD-AS model - social loss and policy intervention** and is about defining, analyzing and interpretiong the AD-AS model when implementing a social loss function and policy interventions respectively. I find the optimal value of government spending (g) and optimal value of alpha1 (sensitivity of aggregate demand to the output gap) that minimizes the social loss. Then I analyze how the steady state is affected by a decrease in the central bank's interest rate.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
